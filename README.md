# TinyConcert
*For descriptions of particular snippets, please open a snippet file, and then click the three dotted box next to my name* Included are snippets of Python/Flask code that were part of a project for a course. The project entailed working with user registrations, concert selections, and seat reservations. Much of this was updated visually on the site as well as in text files.
